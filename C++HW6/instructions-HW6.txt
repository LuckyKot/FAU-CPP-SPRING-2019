For this assignment you will implement three functions that are defined in card.cpp
which is provided with this assignment. A supporting card.h file 
is also provided and should not be changed. The definition of the functions in card.cpp 
cannot be changed. The three functions in the card.cpp file must be implemented. 

A Main.cpp file is also provided which contains 18 test cases for the three functions in card.cpp.
To receive full credit, all 18 test cases must pass. A project will be created that contains
3 files (card.h, card.cpp, and Main.cpp). 

Display your name on the first line in the Main.cpp file where indicated. No other changes
should be made to the Main.cpp file.

You will capture an image of your final test case output and submit that.


Files provided:
Main.cpp
card.cpp
card.h

Create a folder. The folder name should be your name with the homework number.
Example of my folder name would be: karlweiss-hw5
Put the following files in the folder. 
1) Your completed card.cpp file.
2) An image of the console output displaying the test case results.
Now, zip the folder to create a .zip file.
Submit this single .zip file to Canvas.
